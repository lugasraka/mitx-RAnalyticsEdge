# mitx-RAnalyticsEdge (Autumn 2020)
Tweaking my R-scripting skills and experiences by completing this 'all-around' course in Analytics. Many useful knowledge can be learned: ranging from linear regression, visualization to optimization using solvers. Earned a final grade of 90% in the end :)

# What?
This main folder contains all materials and codes that I generated along the course (in total there are 9 weeks + final exam). 
There are reading materials and videos, including Rmarkdown files for the recitation parts, exercises, and assignments for each week to pass

If you have any trouble accessing or reproducing the results, don't hesitate to ping me.
